# airMalta-RedAcre

This is a test automation challenge provided by red acre hiring team:

- This challenge was met by creating a cypress project written in javascript
- The project was uploaded to a github repo, you can clone it using the following link: https://github.com/MohamedAshElbehery/airMalta-RedAcre.git 
or by ssh: git@github.com:MohamedAshElbehery/airMalta-RedAcre.git
- The project aims to find the first available flight price starting today's date
- The project was organized to follow the POM: Page object model practice for code maintainability and avoid repetition
- e2e folder containing the tests
- pages folder: containing each page object with their functions to be used later on in the test
- I used relative xpath's in locating the elements in a good practice and not using absolute xpath's
- You will find couple of xpath's with variables to be passed to them as a good practice to avoid static use of objects
- Cypress documentation for your refrence: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress
- git commands like: git clone, git push and git pull was used here, staging commits and committing them was done through vscode
- I configured the project timeouts to be long in the cypress.config.js file
- Removed the errors on uncaught browser exception in e2e.js

** Thank you for this challenge, talk to you soon :) **
